# ApstraPowerPacks

This project aims to be a repository of interesting ways to use Apstra to solve complicated problems and delight users.

Each sub-directory will be an independent project with its own README.

## CosAIAutoTuning
AI workloads place unique stresses on the network. Packet loss has a particularly deleterious effect. 
To maximize throughput and minimize packet loss, Ethernet uses the DCQCN congestion management protocol, but DCQCN introduces significant operational complexity for human operators. Using Apstra's custom Telemetry Collectors, and Configlets, our automation takes this new challenge in stride, automatically optimizing for throughput and the “right amount” of packet loss.
This was demonstrated at Cloud Field Day 20 by Vikram Singh and Rajagopalan Subrahmanian video here -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87LYgLSr5Js
